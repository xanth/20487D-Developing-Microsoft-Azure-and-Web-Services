# Module 2: Querying and Manipulating Data Using Entity Framework

1. Wherever a path to a file starts with *[Repository Root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20487 repository resides.
 For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, change the path: *[Repository Root]***\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01**.
2. Wherever *[YourInitials]* appears, replace it with your actual initials. (For example, the initials for John Doe will be jd.)
3. Before performing the demonstration, you should allow some time for the provisioning of the different Microsoft Azure resources required for the demonstration. You should review the demonstrations before the actual class, identify the resources, and prepare them beforehand to save classroom time.

24. Ensure the **MyFirstEF** database appears.
25. In **Server**, expand the **MyFirstEF** node, and then expand the **Tables** node.
26. Notice that both classes defined in the **MyFirstEF** project appear as tables, **dbo.Stores** and **dbo.Products**.
    >**Note**: Database tables are usually named in the plural form, which is why Entity Framework changed the names of the generated tables from Store and Product to Stores and Products. The dbo prefix is the name of the schema in which the tables were created.

27. Expand the **dbo.Products** and **dbo.Stores** tables, and then expand the **Columns** node in each of them to see that both the tables have **Id** and **Name** columns, similar to their corresponding class properties.
28. Close **SQL Operations Studio**.
29. Close all open windows.

# Lesson 3: Querying Data

   ```
    To control the release of unmanaged resources used by the context, such as a database connection, use the **using** statement.
7. To create the database, add the following code in the **using** block:
   ```cs
    DbInitializer.Initialize(context);
   ```
8. To select all the courses from the database, in the **using** block under **DBInitializer**, add the following LINQ to the **Entities** code:
   ```cs
    var courses = from c in context.Courses
                  select c;
   ```
9. To print the courses and students list to the console window, in the **using** block after the LINQ to the **Entities** code, add the following code:
   ```cs
    foreach (var course in courses)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Course: {course.Name}");
        foreach (var student in course.Students)
        {

8. To add an empty constructor to the class, paste the following code:
   ```cs
    public SchoolContext()
    {

    }
   ```
9. To add a constructor with the **DbContextOptions\<SchoolContext\>** parameter to the class, paste the following code:
   ```cs
   public SchoolContext(DbContextOptions<SchoolContext> options)
        : base(options)
   {
   }
   ```
10. Locate the **OnConfiguring** method and add the following code:
   ```cs
   if(!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
   {
       optionsBuilder.UseLazyLoadingProxies().UseSqlServer(@"Server=.\SQLEXPRESS;Database=SchoolDB;Trusted_Connection=True;");
   }
   ```
   >**Note**: In your tests, you are going to externally configure the context to use the **InMemory** provider. If you are configuring a database provider by overriding **OnConfiguring** in your context, then you need to add some conditional code to ensure that you configure the database provider only if it has not already been configured.

                    .UseInMemoryDatabase(databaseName: "TestDatabase")
                    .Options;
   ```
13. Add the following **Test Method** to the class:
   ```cs
    [TestMethod]
    public void UpdateTeacherSalaryTest()
    {
        Teacher teacher = new Teacher { Name = "Terry Adams", Salary = 10000 };
        teacher = _teacherRepository.Add(teacher);
        teacher.Salary += 10000;
        teacher = _teacherRepository.Update(teacher);

        using (var context = new SchoolContext(_options))
        {
            var result = context.Teachers.FirstOrDefault((s) => s.PersonId == teacher.PersonId);
            Assert.AreEqual(result.Salary, 20000);
        }
    }
   ```
14. Switch to the Command Prompt window. To change directory to the **InMemory.Dal.Test** project, at the command prompt, run the following command:
    ```bash
    cd InMemory.Dal.Test
    ```
15. To run the all the test methods, paste the following command, and then press Enter:
