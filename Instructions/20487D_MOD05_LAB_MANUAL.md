# Module 5: Hosting Services On-Premises and in Azure

# Lab: Host an ASP.NET Core Service in a Windows Service

#### Scenario

In this lab, you will learn how to create a new **ASP .NET Core** project and use **Kestrel - Run As Service** to
host this project in a new Windows service.
In this lab, you will explore several frameworks and platforms, such as Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Core Web API, and Microsoft Azure that are used for creating distributed applications.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API service.
- Register a new Windows service.
- Host a web application in a Windows service.

### Exercise 1: Creating a new ASP.NET Core Application

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will create a new Web API via ASP.NET Core by using the command prompt.

#### Task 1: Create a new ASP.NET Core Application project

1. Create a new **ASP.NET Core Web API** project by using the command prompt with the **dotnet** tool.
2. Open the project in VSCode and create a new **Models** folder.
3. Open File Explorer navigate to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod05\LabFiles\Exercise1\Assets**.
4. From **Assets** folder copy **Flight.cs** file and paste in the **Models** folder.
5. From **Assets** folder copy **FlightsController.cs** file and paste in the **Controllers** folder.
6. In **BlueYonder.Flights.Service.csproj** locate the last **\<PropertyGroup\>** section and under **\<TargetFramework\>** tag add:
   ```xml
    <RuntimeIdentifier>win7-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>
   ```
    > **Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have a basic Web API ASP.NET Core project.

#### Task 2: Install the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices NuGet package

1. Install the **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices** NuGet package by using the command prompt with the **dotnet** tool.
    > **Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices** NuGet package
   on your ASP .NET Core project that you have created in Task 1 which allows you to run the ASP.NET Core project as a Windows service.

#### Task 3: Modify the Main method to use Kestrel RunAsService hosting

1. Use Microsoft Visual Studio Code to add **using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices;** to the **program.cs** class that allows you to use the **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices** NuGet package that you installed in Task 2.
2. Change the **Main** method implementation by using **Kestrel’s RunAsService hosting** to host your **ASP .NET Core** project in a Windows service.

    ```cs
    CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().RunAsService();
    ```

### Exercise 2: Registering the Windows Service

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will create a new Windows service, start and stop it by using the command prompt with the **sc** tool.

#### Task 1: Register the Windows Service

1. To create a new Windows service, publish the **ASP .NET Core** project that you created earlier into a folder.<br/>
   You do this by using a command line with the **dotnet** tool.
2. Create a new Windows service by using the **sc** command tool, which will take the **.exe** file from the publish in the last point and will host your application in a new Windows service.<br/>
   To do this, at the command prompt, run the following command:<br/>
    ```bash
       sc create {The Service Name} binPath= "{Your publish folder path.exe}"
    ```

#### Task 2: Start the Windows Service and test it

1. Use the sc command line to start your new Windows service.
2. Navigate to your API by using port **5000**, and make sure you are getting the expected response.
3. Use the sc command line to stop the service.
4. Navigate to the same address to see that you are not getting the expected response.
5. Close all open windows.
    > **Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have a new **ASP .NET Core** project that is hosted by a **Windows service**.

# Lab: Host an ASP.NET Core Web API in an Azure Web App

    >**Note**: If your getting an error saying that PowersShell files is not digitally signed, Run the following command: **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass**.
   
    >**Note**: If prompted for Do you want to change the execution policy? type **Y** and then press **Enter**.

#### Task 2: Create a free website

1. Add a new App service in **http://portal.azure.com** with a unique App name:
    ```
       blueyonder-flights-{Your Initials}
    ```
2. In **App Service plan**, type **MyFlightAppService** and in **Pricing tier**, choose **F1**.

#### Task 3: Configure an environment variable and the database connection string

1. To the new web app **blueyonder-flights-{Your Initials}**, add a new setting with the key named **BLUEYONDER_TENANT** and with the the value **Testing** .

    ```
    using System.Net.Http;
    using System.Text;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    ```
3. Replace all the **Run** method implementations with the following code that makes a request to the **Flights booking Azure** Web App that you created in Lab 2:
    ```cs
    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request to the flights booking service.");

    var flightId = req.Query["flightId"];

    var flightServiceUrl = $"http://blueyonder-flights-{Your Initials}.azurewebsites.net/api/flights/bookFlight?flightId={flightId}";
