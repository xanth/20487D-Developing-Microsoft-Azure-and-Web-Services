# Module 6: Deploying and Managing Services

1. Wherever a path to a file starts at *[Repository Root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the directory in which the 20487 repository resides. For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20487 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487**, change the path: *[Repository Root]***\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20487\AllFiles\20487D\Mod01**.
2. Wherever *{YourInitials}* appears, replace it with your actual initials. For example, the initials for **John Doe** will be **jd**.
3. Before performing the demonstration, you should allow some time for the provisioning of the different Microsoft Azure resources required for the demonstration. You should review the demonstrations before the actual class, identify the resources, and then prepare them beforehand to save classroom time.

9.	If a page appears asking for your email address, enter your email address, and then click **Next**. Wait for the **Sign In** page to appear, enter your email address and password, and then click **Sign In**.

	>**Note**: If during sign in, a page appears asking you to choose from a list of previously used accounts, select the account you previously used, and then enter your credentials.

10.	In the left menu of the portal, click **App Services**.
11. In the action bar, click **Add**, select **Web App**, and then at the bottom of the third screen, click **Create**.
12.	In the **App name** box, enter the name **mod6demo1***YourInitials* (Replace *YourInitials* with your initials). This is a unique value, which when combined with the **.azurewebsites.net** suffix is used as the URL to your web app.
13. In the **Resource Group** section, select **Create new**, and then change the name of the resource group to **BlueYonder.Demo.06**.
14.	Click **App Service Plan/Location**, and then click **Create new**.

25. Click **Publish**.
    >**Note**: Visual Studio publishes the application according to the settings that are provided in the profile file. After deployment completes, Visual Studio opens Internet Explorer and displays the web app. The deployment process is quick because the process only copies the content of the application to an existing virtual machine and does not need to wait for a new virtual machine to be created.
26. In the browser, navigate to the following URL:
    ```url
    http://mod6demo1{YourInitials}.azurewebsites.net/api/values
    ```
